"""
This module contains the FraudDetectionSystem class that is responsible for detecting fraudulent activities.

There is several approach to detect fraudulent activities:
1. Rate limiting: Limit the number of actions a user can perform within a certain period.
2. Suspicious activity detection: Detect suspicious activities based on certain thresholds.
3. User behavior analysis: Analyze user behavior to detect fraudulent activities.

Fraud Detection Mechanism:

- Analyse and remove: In this mechanism we can use a Flag on  as fraudulent.
- Prevent: In this mechanism we can use a Throttled exception to prevent the user from performing the action.
