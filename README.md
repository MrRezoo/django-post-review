## Project Overview

The **Post Rating System** allows users to interact with posts by rating them. It implements fraud detection mechanisms to prevent rating manipulation and is designed to handle high traffic with ease. The project is fully containerized using Docker and supports background tasks with Celery.

---

## Features

- User authentication (JWT)
- Post rating with average score and total count
- Fraud detection for rating manipulation
- Asynchronous processing with Celery
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc
- Dockerized for deployment

---

## System Architecture

The system adopts a **microservices architecture**, utilizing Docker for containerization and orchestration. Below are the key components:

```
[User] <-> [Nginx] <-> [Django App] <-> [PostgreSQL]
                          ^
                          |
                          v
                      [Redis Cache]
                          ^
                          |
                          v
                    [Celery Worker]
```

- **Django Application**: Core API handling user interactions.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing posts, ratings, and statistics.
- **Redis**: Caching and fraud detection.
- **Celery Worker**: Asynchronous background task processing.

## Key Components

### 3.1 Post Model

The `Post` model represents user-generated content that can be rated.

```python
class Post(BaseModel):
    title = models.CharField(_("title"), max_length=255)
    content = models.TextField(_("content"))
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `title`: The title of the post.
  - `content`: The body of the post.
  - Inherits from `BaseModel`, which tracks the creation and modification timestamps.

### 3.2 Rate Model

The `Rate` model handles user ratings for each post. Each rating is linked to a user and a post.

```python
class Rate(BaseModel):
    post = models.ForeignKey("Post", on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='rates')
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='rates')
    score = models.IntegerField(
        null=True,
        validators=[
            MinValueValidator(RateScoreEnum.ZERO_STARS), 
            MaxValueValidator(RateScoreEnum.FIVE_STARS)
        ]
    )
    is_suspected = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

### 3.3 PostStat Model

The `PostStat` model maintains aggregated statistics for each post, including the average rating and the total number of ratings.

```python
class PostStat(BaseModel):
    post = models.OneToOneField(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='stat')
    average_rates = models.DecimalField(max_digits=3, decimal_places=2, default=0)
    total_rates = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
```

### 3.4 Caching Strategy

- **Post Statistics Caching**: Post stats (e.g., average rating, total rates) are cached in Redis to reduce load on the database.
- **Pending Rates**: New ratings are stored in Redis before being processed in bulk to optimize database transactions.

### 3.5 Asynchronous Processing with Celery

Celery is used for handling background tasks, such as updating post statistics and applying pending rates.

```python
@shared_task
def apply_pending_rates():
    key = RedisKeyTemplates.pending_rates_key()
    if pending_rates := cache.get(key, []):
        from posts.services.commands.rate import bulk_update_or_create_rates
        bulk_update_or_create_rates(rate_data=pending_rates)
        cache.delete(key)
```

### 3.6 Rate Limiting and Fraud Detection

The system employs a multi-tiered approach to prevent fraudulent rating activities. This includes:

- **Rate Limiting**: Restricting the number of ratings a user can submit within a time period.
- **Fraud Detection**: Detecting abnormal activity, such as a sudden spike in ratings, and marking them as suspicious.

```python
class FraudDetection:
    @classmethod
    def detect_suspicious_activity(cls, post_id: int) -> bool:
        fraud_detect_key = RedisKeyTemplates.format_fraud_detect_key(post_id)
        recent_actions = redis_client.lrange(fraud_detect_key, 0, -1)
        if len(recent_actions) >= cls.suspicious_threshold:
            first_action_time = float(recent_actions[0])
            current_time = time.time()
            if current_time - first_action_time < cls.time_threshold:
                return True
        redis_client.lpush(fraud_detect_key, time.time())
        redis_client.ltrim(fraud_detect_key, 0, cls.last_actions_to_track - 1)
        redis_client.expire(fraud_detect_key, cls.time_threshold)
        return False
```

## Use-Cases

1. **Viewing Posts with Statistics**: Users can view a list of posts, along with statistics like average ratings and total ratings.
2. **Submitting a Rating**: Authenticated users can submit ratings for posts, with the system updating statistics accordingly.
3. **Fraud Prevention**: The system detects and prevents fraudulent activity when abnormal rating patterns are identified.
4. **Post Statistics Update**: Post statistics are updated periodically by background tasks.

---

## Mechanism of Fraud Detection

Fraud detection is implemented to identify and prevent rating manipulation. The system uses Redis to track real-time activity and flags suspicious patterns.

### Fraud Detection Workflow:
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of actions a user can perform within a given period.
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Detects suspicious behavior based on the frequency of ratings in a short time.
