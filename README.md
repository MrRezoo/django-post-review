This module contains the FraudDetectionSystem class that is responsible for detecting fraudulent activities.

There is several approach to detect fraudulent activities:

1. Rate limiting: Limit the number of actions a user can perform within a certain period.
   Example: Allow only 5 login attempts per hour from a single IP address.
2. Suspicious activity detection: Detect suspicious activities based on certain thresholds.
   Example: Flag transactions over $10,000 or multiple small transactions totaling a large amount.
3. User behavior analysis: Analyze user behavior to detect fraudulent activities.
   Example: Identify unusual login locations or sudden changes in spending patterns.


Fraud Detection Mechanism:
- Analyse and remove: In this mechanism we can use a Flag on as fraudulent.
- Prevent: In this mechanism we can use a Throttled exception to prevent the user from performing the action.
