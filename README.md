the key components:

```
[User] <-> [Nginx] <-> [Django App] <-> [PostgreSQL]
                          ^
                          |
                          v
                      [Redis Cache]
                          ^
                          |
                          v
                    [Celery Worker]
```

## System Design Solution

### System Architecture Overview

**Some components are marked with (*) which are not implemented in the current project but are proposed for future**

This system design provides a scalable and resilient architecture for the Post Rating System, balancing performance,
consistency, and fault tolerance. **Eventual consistency** is a consistency model used in distributed computing to
achieve high availability and partition tolerance. It ensures that, given enough time, all replicas of a data item will
converge to the same value. This model allows the system to remain available and partition-tolerant, even if some nodes
are temporarily out of sync.

- *Load Balancer
    - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple API Gateway instances
    - Implements health checks and SSL termination

- *API Gateway
    - Handles authentication and rate limiting (e.g., using JWT tokens)
    - Routes requests to appropriate microservices (e.g., posts, users)

#### Application Servers (Django)

- Processes API requests (e.g., post rating,list of posts, user authentication)
- Implements business logic and fraud detection mechanisms

#### Caching Layer (Redis)

- Stores frequently accessed data (e.g., post statistics in retrieval, rates in submission)
- Implements rate limiting and fraud detection

#### Database Cluster (PostgreSQL)

- Primary data store for posts, users, ratings, and statistics
- *Implements sharding for horizontal scaling (e.g., weighted sharding based on post popularity)

#### Message Queue (Redis)

- Facilitates asynchronous communication between components (e.g., Apply pending rates)
- Ensures reliable message delivery for background tasks (e.g., updating post stats, periodic tasks)

#### Celery Workers

- Process background tasks (e.g., updating post statistics)
- Handle computationally intensive operations asynchronously (e.g., fraud detection, rate processing)

### Data Flow and Consistency Model

The system implements an eventual consistency model to ensure high availability and partition tolerance. Here's how data
flows through the system:

1. User submits a rating:
    - API Gateway validates the request and applies rate limiting (e.g., each user can only send 100 ratings per hour)
    - Application server receives the rating and performs initial validation
    - Rating is temporarily stored in Redis cache (pending rates)
    - Acknowledgment is sent back to the user

2. Background processing:
    - Celery worker periodically processes pending ratings from Redis
    - Updates are applied to the PostgreSQL database in batches
    - Post statistics are recalculated and cached in Redis

3. Read operations:
    - Frequently accessed data (e.g., post statistics) is served from Redis cache
    - Less frequent queries are served directly from the PostgreSQL database

### Scalability and Performance Optimizations

- *Horizontal Scaling
    - Application servers can be scaled horizontally behind the load balancer
    - Database read replicas can be added to handle increased read traffic
- Caching Strategy
    - *Use Read-Through and Write-Through caching for improved performance
    - Use cache-aside pattern for other frequently accessed data
        1. **Read Operation**:
            - Check if the data is in the cache.
            - If the data is found (cache hit), return it.
            - If the data is not found (cache miss), load it from the database, store it in the cache, and then return
              it.
        2. **Write Operation**:
            - Write the data to the database.
            - Invalidate or update the cache to ensure consistency.
    - *Use Redis pipeline for batch operations to reduce round-trip latency
- *Database Sharding
    - Implement horizontal sharding based on post ID or author popularity or user ID
    - Use consistent hashing for efficient data distribution
- Asynchronous Processing
    - Offload computationally intensive tasks to Celery workers (e.g., fraud detection, post statistics)
    - Use message queues to decouple components and ensure reliable processing

### Consistency and CAP Theorem Considerations

The system prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP) from the CAP theorem, sacrificing strong consistency
for better performance and scalability. This choice is suitable for a rating system where occasional inconsistencies are
tolerable.

#### Eventual Consistency

- Ratings may not be immediately reflected in post statistics (e.g., pending rates)
- Background processes ensure data converges to a consistent state over time (e.g., updating post stats, periodic tasks)

#### *Conflict Resolution

- Implement versioning for ratings to detect and resolve conflicts
- Use last-write-wins (LWW) strategy for simplicity, or implement custom merge logic if needed( if two rating conflict
  with each other the one with the latest timestamp will be considered)Â¬

### *Fault Tolerance and Reliability

- Data Replication
    - Use multi-region database replication for disaster recovery
    - Implement read replicas for improved read performance and fault tolerance
- Monitoring and Alerting
    - Implement comprehensive monitoring using tools.(e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
    - Set up alerts for critical system metrics and error rates

### Security Considerations

- Authentication and Authorization
    - Implement JWT-based authentication
    - *Use role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained permissions
- Rate Limiting and Throttling
    - Implement IP-based and user-based rate limiting at the API Gateway level (e.g., 1000 requests per hour)
    - Implement endpoint-specific rate limits to prevent abuse (e.g., `/rate` endpoint)
    - Use Redis to store and manage rate limiting counters

### Future Improvements

1. Implement a recommendation system based on user ratings and behavior
2. Introduce real-time updates using WebSockets, GRPC for live rating updates
3. Implement A/B testing framework for experimenting with different rating algorithms
4. Introduce machine learning-based fraud detection for more sophisticated anomaly detection
5. Implement a content delivery network (CDN) for serving static assets and improving global performance
 
## System Design used in this project

### Performance Optimizations

To handle millions of ratings per post without performance issues:

#### Denormalized Post Statistics

- Store `average_rating` and `total_ratings` in the `PostStat` model
- Update these values asynchronously using Celery tasks

#### Caching Strategy

- Cache post statistics in Redis
- Implement a write-through cache for immediate updates
- Periodically sync cache with the database

#### Batch Processing

- Accumulate new ratings in Redis (pending rates)
- Process and apply ratings in batches using Celery tasks

#### Database Indexing

- Create appropriate indexes on the `Rate` model (user, post)

### Fraud Detection and Rating Stabilization

To prevent sudden, artificial changes in post ratings:

- Time-based Weighted Average
    - Implement a weighted average system that gives more weight to established ratings
    - Gradually incorporate new ratings over time

- Rate Limiting
    - Implement user-based and IP-based rate limiting to prevent rapid-fire ratings

- Anomaly Detection
    - Monitor for unusual patterns in rating behavior (e.g., sudden spikes in low ratings)
    - Flag suspicious activities for review

- Delayed Impact
    - Introduce a delay before new ratings significantly affect the overall score
    - Use a sliding window approach to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
      this approach can help to stabilize the average rating by considering a window
      of recent ratings rather than just the most recent rating.
      This helps to prevent sudden changes in the average rating due to a few anomalous ratings.

## Key Components

### 3.1 Post Model

The `Post` model represents user-generated content that can be rated.

```python
class Post(BaseModel):
    title = models.CharField(_("title"), max_length=255)
    content = models.TextField(_("content"))
```

- **Attributes**:
    - `title`: The title of the post.
    - `content`: The body of the post.
    - Inherits from `BaseModel`, which tracks the creation and modification timestamps.

### 3.2 Rate Model

The `Rate` model handles user ratings for each post. Each rating is linked to a user and a post.

```python
class Rate(BaseModel):
    post = models.ForeignKey("Post", on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='rates')
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='rates')
    score = models.IntegerField(
        null=True,
        validators=[
            MinValueValidator(RateScoreEnum.ZERO_STARS),
            MaxValueValidator(RateScoreEnum.FIVE_STARS)
        ]
    )
    is_suspected = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

### 3.3 PostStat Model

The `PostStat` model maintains aggregated statistics for each post, including the average rating and the total number of
ratings.

```python
class PostStat(BaseModel):
    post = models.OneToOneField(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='stat')
    average_rates = models.DecimalField(max_digits=3, decimal_places=2, default=0)
    total_rates = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
```

### 3.4 Caching Strategy

- **Post Statistics Caching**: Post stats (e.g., average rating, total rates) are cached in Redis to reduce load on the
  database.
- **Pending Rates**: New ratings are stored in Redis before being processed in bulk to optimize database transactions.

### 3.5 Asynchronous Processing with Celery

Celery is used for handling background tasks, such as updating post statistics and applying pending rates.

```python
@shared_task
def apply_pending_rates():
    key = RedisKeyTemplates.pending_rates_key()
    if pending_rates := cache.get(key, []):
        from posts.services.commands.rate import bulk_update_or_create_rates
        bulk_update_or_create_rates(rate_data=pending_rates)
        cache.delete(key)
```

### 3.6 Rate Limiting and Fraud Detection

The system employs a multi-tiered approach to prevent fraudulent rating activities. This includes:

- **Rate Limiting**: Restricting the number of ratings a user can submit within a time period.
- **Fraud Detection**: Detecting abnormal activity, such as a sudden spike in ratings, and marking them as suspicious.

```python
class FraudDetection:
    @classmethod
    def detect_suspicious_activity(cls, post_id: int) -> bool:
        fraud_detect_key = RedisKeyTemplates.format_fraud_detect_key(post_id)
        recent_actions = redis_client.lrange(fraud_detect_key, 0, -1)
        if len(recent_actions) >= cls.suspicious_threshold:
            first_action_time = float(recent_actions[0])
            current_time = time.time()
            if current_time - first_action_time < cls.time_threshold:
                return True
        redis_client.lpush(fraud_detect_key, time.time())
        redis_client.ltrim(fraud_detect_key, 0, cls.last_actions_to_track - 1)
        redis_client.expire(fraud_detect_key, cls.time_threshold)
        return False
```

## Use-Cases

1. **Viewing Posts with Statistics**: Users can view a list of posts, along with statistics like average ratings and
   total ratings.
2. **Submitting a Rating**: Authenticated users can submit ratings for posts, with the system updating statistics
   accordingly.
3. **Fraud Prevention**: The system detects and prevents fraudulent activity when abnormal rating patterns are
   identified.
4. **Post Statistics Update**: Post statistics are updated periodically by background tasks.

---

## Mechanism of Fraud Detection

Fraud detection is implemented to identify and prevent rating manipulation. The system uses Redis to track real-time
activity and flags suspicious patterns.

### Fraud Detection Workflow:

- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of actions a user can perform within a given period.
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Detects suspicious behavior based on the frequency of ratings in a short time.
